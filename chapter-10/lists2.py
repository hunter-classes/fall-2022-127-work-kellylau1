#Write a function called average that takes a list of numbers as a parameter and returns the average of the numbers.

def average(num): 
  for i in num: 
    avg = sum(i)/len(i)
  print(average)

num = [1,2,3]

average(num)

#Write a function sum_of_squares(xs) that computes the sum of the squares of the numbers in the list xs. For example, sum_of_squares([2, 3, 4]) should return 4+9+16 which is 29:

def sum _of_squares(xs):

for i in num: 
    avg = i**2
    add = sum(avg)
  print(avg)
xs = [2,3,4]

sum _of_squares(xs)
